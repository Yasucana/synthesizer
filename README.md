# Synthesizer

This project provides a browser-based music composer with an interactive grid.
Recent updates introduce the following features:

- Delay and reverb effects selectable from the interface.
- Up to three independent tracks that can be edited separately.
- Adjustable number of columns and per-measure tempo patterns.
- Optional harmonics per row via checkboxes next to the grid.
